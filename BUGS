Bugs in tools
-------------
1. trayumount - when user remove USB flash without properly removing it in
   this applet,  directory /media/SOMETHING will stay there and it is 
   impossible to mount this disk again unless you remove this directory 
   (as root).
 
2. trayvolume - does not work with synaptics touchpad (I somehow cannot trigger
   propper wheel events, perhaps it produces pgup/pgdn events instead when
   using touchpad)

3. trayweather - location is hardcoded in source (search for LZKZ)

4. traykeymap - detection of current layout currently works only for US 
   and SK layouts

5. appmenugen - for some reason it put audacious in Development category

6. at strart I rut this command:

     setxkbmap -option compose:rwin,grp:switch,grp:alt_shift_toggle us,sk -variant ,qwerty terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp
  
   When I connect second keyboard, I cannot switch layout on it, it stays the same.
   It switch only layout on first keyboard. When I type "setxkbmap us" to switch to
   us, I lost switching altogether. I don't know solution. Probably this (different 
   layout order):

     1. setxkbmap -option compose:rwin,grp:switch,grp:alt_shift_toggle us,sk -variant ,qwerty terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp
     2. setxkbmap -option compose:rwin,grp:switch,grp:alt_shift_toggle sk,us -variant ,qwerty terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp
    
   or completely ignore xorg layout switching and use my own shortcutkey in jwmrc and some 
   `togglelayout` command.
   
   NOTE: it appears that it just need to reexecute that setxkbcommand when both keyboards are present.
         So perhaps some "daemon" which would monitor keyboard change (/sys/somewhere) and when new
         keyboard is connected, reexecute that command above.
         
         Yes, new files appear in /sys/class/input when this happen, also see bug 7

7. traykeymap - When user connect 2nd keyboard and execute setxkbmap command, it may happen
   that first keyboard when used will indicate SK layout and when typing on second keyboard
   it will indicate US layout. Probably because it uses keyboard leds to detect layout.
   
8. trayusermount - incorrectly display 2 mounted disks when they are both named "DISK" and 
   one is mouted and other is not, it should display them as one mounted and one not 
   mounted.
