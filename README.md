- **trayscript** applet displays output of any (bash) script. Special, user defined,
script is executed every 30s and it's output is displayed in tray. This
script can contain whatever you want to be displayed on tray, e.g. 
`echo "Hello John"` or `df -h / | tail -1 | awk '{ print $4"B free" }'` for
displaying amount of free space on disk. Main purpose of this applet is to
quickly display information for which regular applet do not exist yet. For most
cases this approach is good enough.

disks. It uses pmount, pumount and blkid console tools.

Backend tools
-------------

- **appmenugen** parse all *.desktop files and generate menu with categories. Output is xml
file that can be used as part of JWM config file using this code:

    <!-- application menu -->

- **movemousecursor** is tool which move cursor to bottom right corner of the screen (or any other
location specified by first and second parameter)

- **s** is auxiliary "library" for manipulating strings. Made by C non-programmer for C 
non-programmers. I created it mostly to fight leaks and n-1 bugs.

- **sysmonitor** print various statistics (cpu, memory, disks, network). It is backend for
traymonitor. Traymonitor could read those info directly, but it very rarely
and inexplainably segfaulted while doing so. So it instead run sysmonitor. 
When sysmonitor crash, nothing will happen to traymonitor itself, it will 
just display info in next refresh.

Other tools
-----------

- **poweroffdialog** Simple poweroff dialog with option to reboot or logout and few others:
